# autoencoder with Street View House Numbers(SVHN) Dataset

I build a simple autoencoder with tensorflow and Googles Street View House Numbers Dataset. I converted the RGB-Images to grayscale and scaled the pixel values between 0 and 1 floating point numbers. But the results I get are very poor even if I grow the amount of units in the hidden layer nearly to the size of the input array . I get much better results if I convert the Images to binary values.  

The upper row in each Picture are the input Images the lower row the output images
